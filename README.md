# canisoon-lib

This package turns the caniuse dataset on it's side and builds weekly snapshots of the availibilty statistics for all the features in that dataset.

That data is then used to power canisoon.com, which provides insights into upcoming features that you can't really use yet, but might want to know about, so you can use them ... soon.


# building the next data set ..?


```
yarn ts-node update.ts

npm publish
```


# development

to run the tests:

```
npm run test
```
